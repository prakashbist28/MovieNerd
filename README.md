Movienerd is a website that gives user information about current airing,trending movies/series around the world. 
I made use of TMDb api to get all the information. 
I needed an api key provided by TMDb site to implement the project.

Technologies used: 
â€¢ React js 
â€¢ Material UI 
â€¢ Moviedb API
â€¢ Nodejs


To Secure API keys i placed them on backend because in frontend(client side) despite having .env, .gitignore files api keys can be easily inspected and found
